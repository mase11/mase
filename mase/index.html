          <h2>Sports in secondary schools</h2>
          <p>All pupils in the UK have to do PE or Physical Education at school until they are 16. The sports you can do
            at school depend on your school as each one offers different activities. The most popular sport at school is
            football, played by girls and boys. Pupils play other traditional team games such as rugby, field hockey,
            netball and rounders or do individual physical activities like athletics or gymnastics. Today, some schools
            offer more modern sports and physical activities such as dance, fitness, dodgeball or Ultimate Frisbee.</p>
